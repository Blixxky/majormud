# This Project

MajorMUD was a few-of-it's-kind MORPG (multiplayer online role-playing game) designed for Dial-up BBS's, and later Telnet BBS's. This repo will stand as an ongoing archival project, with additional growth. I released the last patch for MajorMUD 1.11p that enabled SYSOPs to custom edit their MajorMUD (this would have been circa 2000). This enabled SYSOPs to have all of the extensions up to Mod9, the final release; and be able to modify the Btrieve database records to add their own content.

I will be publishing one final patch to MajorMUD WCCMMUD.DLL for MBBS in the spirit of MBBSEmu, so that SYSOPs that have nostalgia don't have to install Worldgroup 3.x to get a copy of MajorMUD running that they can enjoy with others. [MBBSEmu](https://www.mbbsemu.com) is an emulator project that I hold dear to my heart. It's minimalist in nature, whereas the alternatives MBBS and Worldgroup install many other services that aren't necessarily desired in 2023. 

### This project will likely close when the MajorMUD 1.11p WCCMMUD.DLL for MBBS/MBBSEmu has been disassembled and reverse-engineered to allow for the same modifications that the WG 3.x version allows. It will remain for archival purposes of other files as well as a static host for the new WCCMMUD.DLL

# MajorMUD History

Reposted from [Mudinfo.net](https://www.mudinfo.net/viewtopic.php?t=2050#:~:text=MajorMud%20was%20officially%20released%20on,West%20Coast%20Creations%2C%20or%20WCC.)

"MajorMud was officially released on November 4, 1994. The game was created by was created by Lance and Cathy (Dog) Neumann, Michael Skupa (Cat), Craig Young (Morukai), and Geoffrey Rosen (Orfeo) in the early 1990s. Collectively they were known as West Coast Creations, or WCC. On May 25, 1999, WCC sold MajorMUD to Metropolis, a company based in Kansas, USA. Metropolis promised to continue the work done by WCC. Over the years, 9 expansions modules were added, with the first 6 developed by WCC and the last 3 by Metropolis. On April 10, 2008 Metropolis Gameport shut down and sold all 7 of their Worldgroup BBS Game Servers. All updates, maintenance, and user support has been halted."

# Other Living MajorMUD Projects

Here is a list of still alive projects that have furthered MajorMUD development after it's closed source development ended in Mod9.

### Void BBS
Running: WorldGroup 3.3

Homepage: https://www.voidbbs.com

Telnet: voidbbs.com:23

Kyau, the SYSOP of this BBS has modernized his BBS and utilized the databases in a modern web format. The MajorMUD itself has been customized highly with many quality-of-life edits, but kept balance and stayed close to stock. Has a custom Mod10 module that was never released.

### Bear's BBS
Running: WorldGroup 3.x

Homepage: http://bearfather.net

Telnet: bbs.bearfather.net:23

Heavily edited. I didn't progress past level 20 and can't properly review but it appears to keep in balance. 

### GreaterMUD
Running: Custom host

Homepage: http://forums.greatermud.com/forums/index.php

Telnet: greatermud.com:23

I haven't played this MUD, but it seems like an entire recreate of MajorMUD, with many additions. It has since forked into Paradigm MUD or ParaMUD.

### ParaMUD
Running: Custom host

Homepage: http://forums.paramud.com

Telnet mud.paramud.com:23 

This is a fork after the main dev abandoned active dev on GreaterMUD
